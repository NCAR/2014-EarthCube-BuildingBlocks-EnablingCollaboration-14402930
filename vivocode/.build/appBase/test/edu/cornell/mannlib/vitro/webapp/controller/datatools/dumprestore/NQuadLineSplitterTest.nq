Bibo considers this term \"unstable\".  The bibo editorial note is: \"We are not defining, using an enumeration, the range of the bibo:degree to the defined list of bibo:ThesisDegree. We won't do it because we want people to be able to define new degress if needed by some special usecases. Creating such an enumeration would restrict this to happen.\""^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/filegraph/tbox/object-properties.owl> .
