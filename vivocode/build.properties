  #
  # Where is the Vitro core directory?
  # In most deployments, this is set to ./vitro-core (It is not uncommon for this 
  # setting to point elsewhere in development environments).
  #   Examples:
  #      vitro.core.dir = ./vitro-core
  #      vitro.core.dir = ../vitro
  #      vitro.core.dir = /usr/local/vitro/trunk
  #changing to 1.8.1 for now
#vitro.core.dir = ../../vivocode/Vitro
vitro.core.dir = ../../vivocode/vivo-rel-1.8.1/vivo-rel-1.8.1/vitro-core


# Since Climate Change is built on top of the VIVO application, we will also need to indicate where the VIVO code resides
# Where is the NIH-VIVO directory?
#nihvivo.dir = ../../vivocode/VIVO

nihvivo.dir = ../../vivocode/vivo-rel-1.8.1/vivo-rel-1.8.1

  #
  # The base install directory for your Tomcat server. The VIVO application 
  # will be deployed in the /webapps directory below this base. 
  #
tomcat.home = C:/apache/apache-tomcat-7.0.47

  #
  # The name of the VIVO application. This will be used as the name of the
  # subdirectory within your Tomcat server's /webapps directory. It also appears
  # in the URL for the application. For example, http://my.vivo.server/vivo
  #
webapp.name = earthcollabvivo

  #
  # The location where the VIVO application will store the data that it creates.
  # This includes uploaded files (usually images) and the search index.
  #
vitro.home = C:/Users/hjk54/earthcollabdata
