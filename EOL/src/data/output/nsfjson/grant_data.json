			"abstract": " The central goal of this project is to understand the complex linkages between biogeochemical cycles, vegetation, disturbance, and climate across the full summer temperature gradient in the Arctic in order to better predict ecosystem responses to changing climate. The project focuses on frost-boils because: (1) The processes that are involved in the self-organization of these landforms drive biogeochemical cycling and vegetation succession of extensive arctic ecosystems. (2) These ecosystems contain perhaps the most diverse and ecologically important zonal ecosystems in the Arctic and are important to global carbon budgets. (3) The complex ecological relationships between patterned-ground formation, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation and the significance of these relationships at multiple scales have not been studied. (4) The responses of the system to changes in temperature are likely to be nonlinear, but can be understood and modeled by examining the relative strengths of feedbacks between the components of the system at several sites along the natural arctic temperature gradient.",

			"abstract": "Funds are provided to investigate a mechanism by which sea-ice change might affect the very productive, benthic-dominated food webs on shallow arctic shelves - expansion of the ranges and numbers of mobile benthic predators owing to increased temperature of bottom water. The main questions to be addressed are: Is the benthic food web in the north-central Bering Sea limited by top-down control by predators? Are the overwinter survival and/or prebreeding condition of Spectacled Eider (SPEI) being impacted by climate-driven trends in ice cover that are allowing populations of competing crabs and groundfish to expand? To answer these questions, the PIs will: Collect data needed to model the total impact of predators on their main benthic prey in the north-central Bering Sea. These predators include SPEI, groundfish, snow crabs, sea stars, and gastropods, Simulate impacts on the energy balance of the main endotherm predator (SPEI) of variations in crab and groundfish populations expected to occur with changes in ice cover and resulting temperature of bottom water, and Continue a long-term (1950-2004) record of benthic communities in this area that will contribute to the modeling and analyses listed above. Additionally, these data would also indicate whether declines in organic matter supply to sediments that have been measured at a subset of stations have occurred throughout the area, and whether these declines correspond to a decrease in direct precipitation of phytoplankton during and after the ice-edge spring bloom. A major unsolved challenge in modeling food webs of large marine ecosystems is integrating across levels of organization that operate at different temporal and spatial scales that might be critical to the carrying capacity of a large marine ecosystem for the entire predator community and determining how changes in that system affect the energy balance and distribution of top predators. In a novel approach to this problem, this study will integrate a spatially-explicit, individual-based model of the foraging energetics of SPEI with less detailed spatial models of benthic prey and less mobile predators.",

			"abstract": "Zhang 0611967 The PIs propose a model study of the historical and contemporary changes of the Bering Sea ice cover and the impacts of these changes on Bering Sea marine climate. Additionally, they will investigate future changes of the eastern Bering marine environment under global warming scenarios. Their objectives are: 1) To simulate the historical evolution of the eastern Bering ice-ocean system since 1970; 2) To identify key linkages among the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean in order to understand mechanisms affecting physical processes influencing the ecosystem; 3) To examine the interactions between the Bering Sea climate and the Pacific and Arctic climates; and 4) To estimate the state of the marine system under different scenarios of climate change. To achieve these goals they propose to develop a state-of-the-art Bering Ecosystem STudy ice-ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (BESTMAS) for synthesis and modeling of the eastern Bering Sea. BESTMAS will combine advanced sea ice and ocean models with extensive data assimilation and realistic atmospheric, terrestrial, and tidal forcings. It will allow both high-resolution (7 km) simulation of the eastern Bering Sea, and good connections to the central North Pacific and the Arctic. The model output will be used to assist fieldwork planning and data synthesis for the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) and support realistic ecosystem modeling.",

These patterns suggest that long-term warming of the Bering Sea would cause a shift in timing of the spring bloom and, concomitantly, in energy flow from benthic to pelagic communities. The PIs will test the hypothesis that variation in the timing of the spring bloom changes the rate of denitrification in Bering Sea sediments, which will have substantial consequences for productivity in this region. Denitrification in shelf sediments of the southeastern Bering Sea is estimated to remove about one third of the total nitrate supply to the Bering Shelf. The specific hypotheses that the PIs propose to test are: (1) Dentirification covaries with organic matter input to the sediment and infaunal burrow densities, peaking at intermediate infaunal densities, (2) Macrofaunal burrow ventilation rates covary with organic matter input, (3) Return of nitrogen to the overlying water will be a non-linear increasing function of organic-matter input, and (4) The fraction of export production reaching the sediment will change with the timing of sea ice melt. To test these hypotheses, they will participate in oceanographic cruises in 2007-2009, conduct onboard experiments, and collect core samples for the measurement of profiles and fluxes of oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and silicate. They will also collect samples for measurement of 222Rn and 210Pb profiles, from which they will calculate sediment bioirrigation rates and bulk sedimentation rates, respectively. This combination of measurements will allow them to estimate sedimentary denitrification rates, overall benthic carbon oxidation rates, macrobenthic irrigation rates and organic-matter burial rates, and to test their hypotheses. Additionally, they will use the data to construct a mathematical model of sedimentary nitrogen cycling that can be used as a boundary condition for larger Bering Sea Ecosystem models. It is assumed that, at present, the nitrogen needed to fuel the primary production on the Bering Sea shelf is derived from cross-shelf transport of oceanic waters and denitrification in shelf sediments. How the relative importance of these two sources of nitrogen would change under an altered ice regime and the consequences for the ecosystem remain important unanswered questions. This research effort should provide a considerable improvement in our knowledge of existing conditions and our projections of future conditions.",

New production is indicative of the total amount of organic material available for higher levels of the food chain and the ratio of new to total nitrogen production (the co-ratio) indicates the degree to which production is linked to grazing within the water column. This ecological information will be used to characterize the partitioning of primary production between water column and bottom-dwelling consumers and how this changes with conditions on the shelf. The PIs hypothesize that the seasonal development of regenerated production will be closely associated with that of the zooplankton populations and thus the nitrogen productivity data will test a key component of the oscillating control hypothesis that links climate variability to the flow of nutrition through the food web. Community composition will be evaluated in parallel with nitrogen productivity because significant successional as well as year-to-year changes in phytoplankton have been observed on the eastern Bering shelf. This project also will measure the natural isotopic ratios of both the nitrate supply (both 15N/14N and 18O/16O) and the forms of nitrogen produced (the 15N/14N of suspended and sinking particles, dissolved organic N and ammonium). These measurements provide a passive isotope approach that will reflect the intensity of nitrate assimilation and provide a new constraint on shelf new production. The project will calibrate this new approach against tracer incubation measurements. The passive isotope approach should be particularly useful in quantifying new production in hydrodynamically complex, but ecologically important regions, such as the shelf break, that are difficult to characterize with standard budgets and incubation-based measurements. Finally, the PIs will examine the processes for year-to-year variations of combined nitrogen on the shelf. This analysis will be used to test the hypothesis that variations in physical and biological processes may influence productivity of larger organisms by controlling the amount of combined nitrogen available on the shelf for growth.",

Funds are provided to test the following core hypothesis: climate-driven interannual variability in sea-ice extent and duration shifts the eastern Bering Sea autotrophic community between one of two states; marginal ice-zone (MIZ) blooms vs. open-water blooms. The MIZ bloom state is characterized by high biomass, diatom-dominated blooms, high pelagic export and tight pelagic-benthic coupling, whereas the open-water bloom state is characterized by lower biomass, flagellate blooms, low pelagic export, and reduced pelagic-benthic coupling. This project will generate measurements of primary production using traditional 14C, 13C methods, and use the innovative triple oxygen isotope technique and dissolved oxygen concentrations to estimate gross and net primary production, respectively. This combination of productivity measurements will be used to test the hypothesis that while gross primary production does not change with sea-ice extent, net production does, and is inversely related to sea-ice extent. Phytoplankton community structure measurements will allow the PIs to test their hypothesis that the autotrophic community switches from a diatom-dominated, high export system in the MIZ, to a flagellate-dominated, lower export, system in open water blooms. This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters. This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska. Characterization of rates of primary production by phytoplankton and the varying structure of the phytoplankton community in response to changing sea ice conditions will provide information about changes at the base of the food chain that will constrain models of the ecosystem. This information will be essential to a successful integrated ecosystem modeling protocol for the region.",

The 2008-2010 field effort will focus on the central Bering Sea shelf and will employ both hydrography, including extensive d18O sampling, and a nine-mooring array that spans most of the central shelf. The moorings variously will carry ADCPs, T/C recorders, fluorometers, and temperature chains. The measurements will be augmented by hydrographic and d18O sampling and drifter studies under other support. Analysis will also incorporate wind forcing, coastal discharges, surface buoyancy fluxes, and ice thickness and drift into the synthesized data set and its interpretation. These data, in conjunction with another mooring program funded elsewhere, will provide much of the background circulation and stratification information necessary to place the biological data from BEST in context.",

			"abstract": "Moran 0732680 Univ. of Rhode Island Funds are provided to test the following core hypothesis: climate-driven interannual variability in sea-ice extent and duration shifts the eastern Bering Sea autotrophic community between one of two states; marginal ice-zone (MIZ) blooms vs. open-water blooms. The MIZ bloom state is characterized by high biomass, diatom-dominated blooms, high pelagic export and tight pelagic-benthic coupling, whereas the open-water bloom state is characterized by lower biomass, flagellate blooms, low pelagic export, and reduced pelagic-benthic coupling. This project will generate measurements of primary production using traditional 14C, 13C methods, and use the innovative triple oxygen isotope technique and dissolved oxygen concentrations to estimate gross and net primary production, respectively. This combination of productivity measurements will be used to test the hypothesis that while gross primary production does not change with sea-ice extent, net production does, and is inversely related to sea-ice extent. Phytoplankton community structure measurements will allow the PIs to test their hypothesis that the autotrophic community switches from a diatom-dominated, high export system in the MIZ, to a flagellate-dominated, lower export, system in open water blooms. This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters. This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska. Characterization of rates of primary production by phytoplankton and the varying structure of the phytoplankton community in response to changing sea ice conditions will provide information about changes at the base of the food chain that will constrain models of the ecosystem. This information will be essential to a successful integrated ecosystem modeling protocol for the region.",

			"abstract": "Funds are provided to study the role of sea ice algae in the food web of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem. The scarce observations available from the Bering Sea indicate that ice algal production may be as high as 30% of the phytoplankton production; during times of ice cover, ice algal biomass can be nearly as high as integrated pelagic algal biomass. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that sea ice algae are the major food source for pelagic and benthic herbivores in spring, specifically during periods of ice melt. In addressing this hypothesis, this proposal aims at providing information on the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, biomass, community composition and productivity of sea ice algae and phytoplankton just below the ice in relation to the physical and chemical environment. Environmental measurements will include salinity, temperature, and nutrient concentrations in ice cores and under-ice water, as well as ice thickness, snow cover and light regime. Sedimenting material, stable isotope ratios (d13C, d15N) and algal community composition will be used as three lines of evidence to follow the fate of ice algal production through the pelagic and into the benthic food web of the Bering Sea. Field work conducted during different ice cover regimes will be augmented with experimental work on pelagic and benthic herbivores, producing the first-ever stable isotope turnover rate measurements for any Bering Sea invertebrates. The combined data set will allow for a refined interpretation of the relevance of the sea ice produced organic matter for the food web structure in the Bering Sea. This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters. This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska. Understanding role of sea ice algae in this system is essential to being able to predict how and why the system may respond to changes in sea ice conditions, such as have been observed in recent years.",

The principal investigators inquire how changes in sea ice affect advection and mixing; how variable fluxes of low-salinity, nutrient-deficient coastal waters may affect production; how cross-shelf fluxes are established and altered; how these fluxes might respond to climate change; how the seasonal stratification cycle is controlled; and how the buoyant coastal flow evolves. The 2008-2010 field effort will focus on the central Bering Sea shelf and will employ both hydrography, including extensive d18O sampling, and a nine-mooring array that spans most of the central shelf. The moorings variously will carry ADCPs, T/C recorders, fluorometers, and temperature chains. The measurements will be augmented by hydrographic and d18O sampling and drifter studies under other support. Analysis will also incorporate wind forcing, coastal discharges, surface buoyancy fluxes, and ice thickness and drift into the synthesized data set and its interpretation. These data, in conjunction with another mooring program funded elsewhere, will provide much of the background circulation and stratification information necessary to place the biological data from BEST in context.",

			"abstract": "Funds are provided to support a benthic-focused measurements program in the northern Bering Sea that extends and expands a twenty-year effort in that region. The northern benthic biological communities are known to provide food resources for benthic-feeding apex predators that include gray whales, bearded seals, walruses, and diving sea-ducks, all of which are used by subsistence-based communities along the Bering Sea coast. Previous work indicates that climate warming may change the present benthic-dominated northern Bering Sea ecosystem to one that is more pelagic and similar to the southern Bering Sea food web. The principal investigators will document benthic infaunal community composition and biomass as a means to determine key indicator species that should be monitored to evaluate climate change impacts on the Bering Sea ecosystem. In addition, they will undertake analyses of sediment indicators of status and trends in ecosystem health, including sediment grain size, oxygen demand, chlorophyll inventories, organic carbon content and stable carbon isotope ratios of sediment organic carbon, and inventories of atmospherically-derived, particle-reactive radionuclides (7Be) and clay-associated radionuclides (137Cs). All of these can be used as ecosystem indicators of recent particle deposition, sediment processing, and the overall fertility of overlying waters. They will integrate these new data with the extensive record for the region. These data will help interpret data collected by collaborators, with other funding, concerning marine mammals. It will also serve a important constraints on the models being developed for the region, both within the BEST and BSIERP programs.",

			"abstract": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This study will test hypotheses about the responses of marine birds to spatial and temporal variability in ocean processes in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Using a data set of over a million records compiled over thirty years, this group will analyze (1) seasonal patterns of seabird occupancy of various ocean domains, (2) the stability of distributional patterns of seabird species among oceanographic habitats at annual to decadal time scales and (3) temporal patterns in seabird abundance within different ocean regions over annual to decadal time-scales. The approach will permit testing the temporal stability of patterns in distribution and abundance previously hypothesized to be important, but for which initially only one to three years of data were available. The researchers will seek mechanistic explanations for the patterns observed in seabird distribution and abundance using concurrently-obtained physical and biological data, where available. These data include information on zooplankton distribution and abundance collected during seabird surveys since the early 1990s, monitoring conducted by the Japanese training ship Oshoro Maru, and the distribution and abundance of forage species as determined by the NOAA bottom trawl and acoustic surveys. These evaluations of seabirds-at-sea in relation to ocean conditions will provide a broad evaluation of the utility of pelagic studies of seabirds as indicators of ocean conditions. This study is the first to examine the at-sea distribution and abundance of seabirds over a 30+ year period. It is expected to show how seabirds have responded to climate-driven changes in hydrographic conditions and in the distribution and abundance of zooplankton and forage fish over the southeastern Bering Sea shelf. It will be the first high-latitude study to test how the responses of piscivorous and planktivorous (and diving vs. surface-foraging) seabird species to ecosystem change may differ.",

Durbin 0909415 University of Rhode island Mesozooplankton play a critical role in determining carbon flow from primary producers to higher trophic levels. In the SE Bering Sea interannual changes in the timing and extent of both sea ice cover and summer stratification will affect their role in determining the path of carbon flow, whether through the pelagic ecosystem or to the benthos. Knowledge of the actual in situ mesozooplankton diet composition and ingestion rates is essential to understanding the flow of carbon in this system. Information about these rates using traditional bottle incubation techniques will be compromised because of the strong vertical gradients in the mesozooplankton prey environment making sampling the appropriate prey field difficult. The PIs propose a field investigation of in situ feeding rates by copepods on the SE Bering shelf during spring and summer using a novel molecular technique they have developed to quantitatively measure ingestion rates on different prey species from stomach content analysis. They will use the 18S ribosomal RNA gene as a marker to identify different prey species present in the guts of copepods and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) to measure copy number of this gene for each prey species. Ingestion rates will be calculated from this gut content information, 18S copy number/organism, and DNA digestion rates. By combining these in situ ingestion rate measurements with zooplankton abundance measurements and the prey field composition, they will be able to determine the fate of phytoplankton production under the varying environmental conditions. Ultimately, they plan to use these in situ consumption estimates to evaluate the role of copepods in carbon flow in the Bering shelf ecosystem.",

			"abstract": "Concern about the potential impact of climate change on the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem prompted a study of the species composition, abundance and biomass of the mesozooplankton populations forming the ecosystem and estimation of population trends as part of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST). The PIs have been previously funded to collect and process approximately 260 zooplankton samples from the eastern Bering Sea during each of two cruises per year for the three BEST field seasons, to analyze the data, and to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. However, during field collection, the need for additional information was identified in order to ensure robust results. In response to these needs, an additional 200 samples per year were collected during the BEST cruises. This award funds the processing of those samples. The entire rational of the BEST ecosystem study is based on the fundamental hypothesis that the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem is changing under the influence of climate. The goal of the BEST research effort is to identify and quantify mechanistic links between climate and the ecosystem response. An ecosystem responds to changes in climate forcing by altering the abundance, biomass and species composition of its constituent populations. Therefore, a central requirement of the research is to collect and process a sufficient number of samples to determine robustly the state of the system during the study, estimate the direction or magnitude of change, if any, to validate or refute hypotheses concerning change, and to adequately validate or parameterize the lower trophic level models generated by other program participants. Processing of the 200 extra samples per year will substantially improve our ability to detect statistically significant changes in zooplankton populations during the BEST program, thus helping to address the above requirements.",
